# MTRdle (a.k.a. Subwaydle-HK)

A Hong Kong MTR-based fork of the original [Subwaydle](https://www.subwaydle.com) game. Contains some source code lifted from the [open-source clone](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/word-guessing-game) by Hannah Park. Subwaydle is a static JavaScript app, written using Create React App with React, Sass, Semantic UI React and Maplibre (with Stadia Maps). A few Ruby scripts were written to generate JSON data files used by the app.

Main differences between this and the original are that game logic is simplified as trains don't interline and don't have special weekend patterns, but trains can platform at the station far away from each ohter. Additional game logic added to use preferred cross-platform interchanges.

## Running locally

yarn install
yarn start

* Ruby scripts in the `scripts/` directory produce the JSON files in `src/data` that are used by the app. *Warning:* viewing the `src/data` can reveal spoilers to the puzzle! All guesses are checked against the keys in the `solutions.json` file to be a valid trip, and the `answers.json` contains an array for the answer of each day. The values of the `solutions.json` object contain an example trip of stations that are traveled through for the trip.
